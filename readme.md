## Instructions to run any of these files:  

In a node environment, run node and the name of the file:  
example: `node scratchpad.js`  

Note: Make sure you cd into the correct folder if necessary.

## Debugging
I'm using auto attach for debugging.

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_auto-attach
When auto attach is on, the Auto Attach item will appear in the status bar across the bottom of the VS Code window. Clicking it allows you to change the auto attach mode, or temporarily turn it off. Temporarily turning off auto attach is useful if you're running some one-off programs where you don't need debugging, but you don't want to disable the feature entirely.
